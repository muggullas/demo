# Amazon RDS Terraform Module

## Overview

This Terraform module allows you to provision an Amazon RDS instance in AWS (Amazon Web Services). Amazon RDS is a managed relational database service that makes it easy to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before using this Terraform module, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

1. **AWS Account**: You should have an AWS account. If you don't have one, you can sign up for [AWS Free Tier](https://aws.amazon.com/free/) to get started.

2. **Terraform Installed**: You must have Terraform installed on your local machine. You can download it from the [official Terraform website](https://www.terraform.io/downloads.html).

3. **AWS CLI Installed**: Ensure you have the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) installed and configured with your AWS credentials. You can install and configure it by following the [AWS CLI documentation](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/).

4. **SSH Key Pair**: If you intend to connect to your RDS instance, you should have an SSH key pair. You can create one using the `aws ec2 create-key-pair` command.

### Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/terraform-aws-rds.git
   cd terraform-aws-rds
